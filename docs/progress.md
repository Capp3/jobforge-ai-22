# JobForge AI Local Setup Progress

## Analysis Progress (2024-08-07)

### Initial Assessment
- Completed review of existing codebase structure
- Identified React/TypeScript frontend with Supabase backend
- Reviewed Supabase configuration (URL, project ID)
- Analyzed database schema via migration files
- Identified authentication dependencies in the code

### Key Findings
- The application uses Row-Level Security (RLS) policies that depend on authenticated users
- Frontend code makes direct Supabase client calls with authentication
- Database schema includes user_id references to auth.users table

## Next Steps

- Determine if full Supabase functionality is needed or just PostgreSQL
- Research self-hosted Supabase options
- Explore alternatives for simplified local setup
- Develop plan for minimal frontend code changes
