# Architecture Decision Record - JobForge AI SQLite Setup

## Context

### System Requirements:
- Run the application locally with complete data ownership
- Simplified backend with minimal external dependencies
- No authentication requirements (single-user local app)
- Self-contained setup for personal job hunting automation
- Maintain React frontend with minimal changes

### Migration Background:
This application was originally built with Supabase Cloud but has been migrated to a local-only architecture using SQLite and Express.js for better simplicity, data ownership, and offline capabilities.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components:

#### 1. Frontend Application (React/TypeScript + Vite)
- **Purpose/Role:** User interface for job management and preferences
- **Technology Stack:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **API Integration:** REST API client connecting to local Express server
- **State Management:** React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state

#### 2. Backend API (Express.js + Node.js)
- **Purpose/Role:** REST API server for data operations
- **Technology Stack:** Express.js, TypeScript (tsx for development)
- **Port:** 3001 (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- **Features:** CORS enabled, JSON middleware, health check endpoint

#### 3. Database (SQLite + better-sqlite3)
- **Purpose/Role:** Local file-based data storage
- **Technology:** SQLite with better-sqlite3 driver
- **Location:** `data/jobforge.db` (auto-created)
- **Features:** Foreign key constraints, automatic indexing, ACID compliance

## Database Schema

### Tables:
1. **jobs** - Job listings and application tracking
   - Core fields: id, title, company, location, salary_range, status
   - AI fields: ai_rating, ai_notes, rating, reasoning
   - Processing fields: unique_id, date_processed, emailed
   - Metadata: created_at, updated_at, source, date_posted

2. **preferences** - User job search preferences
   - Location and work mode preferences
   - Salary and career level requirements
   - Technology stack preferences
   - LLM configuration (Ollama endpoint, models)

3. **rss_feeds** - RSS feed sources configuration
   - Feed URLs and processing status
   - Last processed timestamps and error tracking

4. **llm_configurations** - LLM provider settings
   - Provider API keys and endpoints
   - Model selection and configuration

5. **application_events** - Application lifecycle events
   - Event tracking and milestones
   - Workflow automation triggers

6. **follow_up_actions** - Scheduled follow-up tasks
   - Due dates and completion status
   - Action type and descriptions

7. **interviews** - Interview scheduling
   - Interview types and preparation
   - Scheduling and outcome tracking

## API Architecture

### REST Endpoints:
- **Jobs API** (`/api/jobs`): Full CRUD operations with filtering
- **Preferences API** (`/api/preferences`): User preferences management
- **Health Check** (`/api/health`): Service status monitoring

### Data Flow:
```
Frontend (React) â†’ API Client â†’ Express Server â†’ SQLite Database
```

## Technology Decisions

### Why SQLite over PostgreSQL/Supabase?
1. **Simplicity**: Single file database, no server setup required
2. **Data Ownership**: Complete local control of job hunting data
3. **Offline First**: Works without internet connectivity
4. **Zero Configuration**: Automatic database creation and schema setup
5. **Performance**: Excellent for single-user applications
6. **Portability**: Easy backup and migration (single file)

### Why Express.js over Direct Database Access?
1. **API Consistency**: Maintains REST API pattern from Supabase migration
2. **Data Validation**: Server-side validation and sanitization
3. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add authentication, file uploads, etc.
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error responses and logging
5. **CORS Handling**: Proper cross-origin request support

### Why React Query?
1. **Server State Management**: Efficient caching and synchronization
2. **Optimistic Updates**: Better UX with immediate UI feedback
3. **Error Handling**: Automatic retry and error state management
4. **Background Sync**: Automatic data refetching and cache invalidation

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Mode:
```
npm run dev:full
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend: Vite dev server (localhost:8080)
â””â”€â”€ Backend: tsx watch mode (localhost:3001)
```

### Production Mode:
```
npm run build && npm run start:prod
â”œâ”€â”€ Frontend: Static files served by Express
â””â”€â”€ Backend: Express server (localhost:3001)
```

## Migration Benefits

### From Supabase Cloud to Local SQLite:
- âœ… **No External Dependencies**: Completely self-contained
- âœ… **Data Privacy**: All data stays local
- âœ… **Cost**: Zero ongoing costs
- âœ… **Offline Capability**: Works without internet
- âœ… **Simplified Setup**: Single command startup
- âœ… **Easy Backup**: Copy single database file
- âœ… **Development Speed**: No network latency

### Maintained Capabilities:
- âœ… **Full CRUD Operations**: All job management features
- âœ… **Real-time UI Updates**: React Query provides optimistic updates
- âœ… **Data Validation**: Server-side validation maintained
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states
- âœ… **Performance**: SQLite is extremely fast for this use case

## Current Features & Future Considerations

### âœ… Implemented Features:
1. **AI Integration**: Complete two-tier LLM system with Ollama/OpenAI integration for job filtering
2. **Application Workflow**: Full lifecycle management with events, follow-ups, and interview tracking
3. **Interactive Dashboard**: Tabbed interface with Overview, Jobs, Pipeline Kanban, and Analytics
4. **LLM Configuration**: Dynamic model discovery and provider testing

### ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements:
1. **RSS Processing**: Automated feed parsing and job import
2. **Email Notifications**: Job alert system
3. **Data Import/Export**: Backup and restore functionality
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Job market insights and trends

### Scalability Notes:
