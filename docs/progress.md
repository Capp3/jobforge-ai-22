  - `/workspaces/jobforge-ai-22/src/components/jobs/index.ts`: Verified (component exports)
- **Key Implementation**:
  - Full React Query integration with caching and optimistic updates
  - Real-time job updates via Supabase subscriptions
  - Comprehensive job filtering and search functionality
  - Algorithm control interface (RSS processing, AI filtering, email delivery)
  - Job status management with user actions (apply, reject, etc.)
  - Responsive UI with shadcn/ui components
- **Status**: React frontend ready to display and interact with algorithm results

### Next Phase
- **Phase 4**: Integration Testing & Deployment
  - Deploy Edge Functions to Supabase
  - Test complete algorithm workflow

  - Add preferences management UI

### Technical Notes
- Edge Functions use Deno runtime (linter errors are expected)
- Database migration includes default RSS feed and preferences
- Email delivery includes placeholder for actual email service integration
- AI filtering includes simulation logic (to be replaced with actual AI services)

## Previous Analysis (2024-08-07)

### Initial Assessment
- Completed review of existing codebase structure
- Identified React/TypeScript frontend with Supabase backend
- Reviewed Supabase configuration (URL, project ID)
- Analyzed database schema via migration files
- Identified authentication dependencies in the code

### Key Findings
- The application uses Row-Level Security (RLS) policies that depend on authenticated users
- Frontend code makes direct Supabase client calls with authentication
- Database schema includes user_id references to auth.users table

## Architecture Decision

**Final Direction**: Supabase Cloud + Edge Functions implementation following project brief algorithm
- Replaced local Docker approach with cloud-based solution
- Implemented algorithm using Edge Functions for serverless execution
- Enhanced database schema to support full workflow
- Ready for React frontend integration
